// Modularize your code into sub-steps so we can re-use bits and pieces as needed.  In JavaScript, these sub-steps are called FUNCTIONS!

// Example of a basic FUNCTION.

function sayHello() { // sayHello creates a function.  It consists of only one statement that will make a message appear in the console "Hello!".
  console.log("Hello!");
}

console.log("Start of program");
sayHello();
console.log("End of program.");

// The declaration of a function is performed using the JavaScript keyword function, followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses.  Statements that make up the function constitute the body of the fucntion.  These statements are enclosed in curly braces and indented. 

// Use FUNCTIONS to get ride of code duplication; instead of duplicated in several places, a piece of code can be centralized in a function and called from anywhere when needed.

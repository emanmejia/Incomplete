// Functions can include everything you can use in a regular program: variables, conditionals, loops, etc.  Functions can call one another, giving the programmer an enormous amount of freedom for building programs.

// However, not everything deserves to be in its own function.  It's better to write short and focused ones, in order to limit dependencies and improve program understanding. 

// We've already learend prompt() and alert().  There are many others in the language.  Get to know them instead of reinventing the wheel!

// Here is an example demonstrating two of the JS mathematical functions.

console.log(Math.min(4.5, 5));  // 4.5
console.log(Math.min(19, 9));  // 9
console.log(Math.min(1, 1));  // 1
console.log(Math.random());  // A random number between 0 and 1.

// Math.min() returns the minimum number among its arguments.
// Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1.

// Limit your function complexity, 30 lines of code should be max for non-specific cases.

// Name your functions and parameters well.  Function naming is just as important as variable naming.  You should choose names that express clearly the function purpose and following a naming convention.  Refer to the appendix for some useful advice.

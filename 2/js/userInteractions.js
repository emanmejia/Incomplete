// Once you start using variables, you can write progams that exchange information with the user.

const name = prompt("Enter your first name:");
alert(`Hello, ${name}`);

// The value you entered in the first dialog box has been stored as a string in the variable name.  The JavaScript command alert() then triggered the display of the second box, containing the result of the concatenation of the string "Hello, " with the value of the 'name' variable.

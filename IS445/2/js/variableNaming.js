// The computer doesn't care about variable names.  You could name your variables using the classing example of a single letter (a, b, c ...) or choose absurd names like 'burrito' or 'RoaringKitting'.

// Naming variables well can make your code much easier to read.  Two examples.

const a = 5.5;
const b = 3.14;
const c = 2 * a * b;
console.log(c);

// On the other hand you could do this -

const radius = 5.5;
const pi = 3.14;
const perimeter = 2 * pi * radius;
console.log(perimeter);

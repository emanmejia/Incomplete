// Here is a JS representation of a blue BIC ballpoitn pen.

// The object has three properties: type, color, brand.  Seperated by comma except the last one.  

const pen = {
  type: "ballpoint", // these key values are called object literals, they go inside the curly braces {}
  color: "blue",
  brand: "BIC"
};  // semicolon is optional, but it is best practice to put it. 

console.log(pen);
